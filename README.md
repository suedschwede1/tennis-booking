# Tennis Booking System

Laravel-based court booking system for a tennis club.
Replaces the old Zend/Laminas system (`booking`).

## Stack

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| PHP | 8.3 |
| Laravel | 13.x |
| Database | MySQL (`booking_local`) |
| Frontend | Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Vite |
| Deployment | Shared hosting over SSH (details kept locally) |

## Features

### Booking calendar (public + account area)

- Calendar view of all courts (squares), day/week navigation, login-gated booking
- Booking modes: **Singles** (2 players, teammate via user search) and **Doubles**
  (4 players, teammates as free text)
- Repeat/subscription bookings (single occurrence vs. whole series editable separately)
- Peak-time player limits, configurable per time window (`PeakLimitService`)
- Daily booking limit per user per court, with a short-booking exception for slots
  starting within 30 minutes
- Club events shown on the calendar (admin-managed, own color/marker)
- Account area: own bookings list, edit profile, change password
- Booking/cancellation confirmation emails

### Admin area (booking)

- User management (create/edit, bulk actions, password reset, `admin`/`assist`/`enabled`
  status, per-`assist`-user `allow.*` permission flags)
- Club event management
- Booking management: list, create/edit/cancel/delete on behalf of users, statistics
- Configuration: general options, behavior settings, squares (courts), test mail sending
- Database page: migration status/repair via `DatabaseSchemaChecker` (no SSH/cron
  needed on shared hosting), on-demand DB backup/restore/download

### Members module (club administration)

- Member management: CRUD (no delete — departure via `left_at`), inline edit-in-place
  fields, status tracking (aktiv/ruhend/ausgetreten), CSV import, export
- Fiscal years and fee categories with per-year rates
- Dues (Beiträge): generation per fiscal year, payment tracking, bulk-mark-paid with a
  configurable "bezahlt bis" year, inline editing
- Club roles (Funktionen): named roles (e.g. board members), each taggable with
  multiple mail categories to target them from the mail composer
- Mail: bulk email composer with saved templates, live preview, and dynamic audiences
  (by club role, mail category, or other member filters), per-member send history
- DSGVO (GDPR) settings page
- Dashboard: member/dues KPIs, side-by-side charts, breakdown by fee category

### JSON API & MCP server

- Versioned JSON API (`/api/v1/...`) for bookings, events, members, and dues
  (create/edit only), authenticated with Laravel Sanctum personal access tokens
- Tokens are issued/revoked exclusively by an admin via `/admin/api-tokens` — there is
  no public login endpoint; external integrations get a token handed to them
- The same module also exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over HTTP at
  `/api/v1/mcp`, so LLM clients can call the same four resources as tools, using the
  same bearer token

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the UI/design system and
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a dated history of changes.

## Security

**No MFA.** Deliberate decision — this is a booking system, not a system with sensitive
financial/personal data behind the login, and login needs to be fast (members book
courts on their phone between games). MFA would add friction disproportionate to the
risk. Compensating controls instead:

- **Rate limiting** (`App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController`): login attempts are
  throttled on three independent keys — `email+ip` (5 attempts), `ip` (25 attempts), and
  `account` (8 attempts) — each triggering a 10-minute lockout via Laravel's
  `RateLimiter`. Every attempt (success/failure/throttled) is logged with IP and user
  agent; a login from a previously-unseen IP for a known user is logged at `notice`.
- **Geo-blocking**: logins can be blocked by country via `BOOKING_BLOCKED_LOGIN_COUNTRIES`
  (comma-separated ISO country codes) in `.env`, resolved via `stevebauman/location`
  (IP geolocation). Empty by default (no blocking) — set per deployment if needed.
- **Risk-based email verification**: a login that looks risky — unusual country vs. the
  user's 30-day history, 2+ recent failed attempts, or impossible travel within 24h —
  requires a 6-digit email code to complete, instead of logging in immediately. Normal
  logins are unaffected; this only kicks in as an actual second factor when something
  looks wrong. Backed by a 30-day `login_history` table (`App\Models\LoginHistory`,
  `App\Services\LoginRiskEvaluator`). Country-based checks fail open when the MaxMind
  GeoLite2 database file is missing (untracked, per-deployment download). Admins can
  view a user's login history (including which flags fired) read-only from their edit
  page.

## Local development

```bash
# Dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Configure .env (DB: booking_local)
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Dev server
php artisan serve       # http://localhost:8001
npm run dev             # Vite HMR

# Tests (via WSL)
php artisan test
```

> **Important:** always run `php`/`composer` via WSL, never directly in PowerShell.

## Deployment

Deployment details (host, account, paths, ssh alias, runbook and the deploy script) are
kept in local operational notes that are not part of this repository. Generic guidance:

- **Base path**: the app may be served under a sub-path of the domain (for example
  `/booking`) with its `public/` directory exposed there. Routes are declared without the
  base path, and views must build URLs with `url()`/`route()` (never root-absolute
  `'/bookings/...'`; a test enforces this). `public/.htaccess` is the front controller and
  must stay committed.
- **`.env` stays on the server only** and is never overwritten by a deploy (nor is
  `storage/`). Set at least:

  ```dotenv
  APP_URL=https://example.com/booking
  SESSION_DRIVER=database       # the `sessions` table is created by `php artisan migrate`
  SESSION_PATH=/booking
  SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
  CACHE_STORE=file              # no `cache` table is created; do not use the database store
  ```

  plus the DB credentials and `TOURNAMENT_BASE_URL` (leave it **empty** when the tournament
  pages of the legacy ZF2 system are served on the same host, see below; set a full URL only
  for a separate tournament host).
- **Mail**: SMTP via a dedicated mailbox (`MAIL_*` in the server `.env`).
- **Cron**: if the scheduler is used, add a cron job running
  `php <app-dir>/artisan schedule:run` every minute.
- **No Node.js on the server**: run `npm run build` locally and commit `public/build/`.
  If WSL's Node is too old (and `node_modules` holds Windows-only native bindings), run
  `npm run build` from **Windows** and commit `public/build`.
- **Deploy script** (local, untracked): it builds assets, ships `git archive HEAD`, keeps
  the server's `.env` and `storage/`, puts the site into maintenance mode, replaces the
  repo-owned dirs (`app database routes resources config lang Modules`), deletes generated
  `bootstrap/cache/*.php`, runs `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`,
  `optimize:clear`, `php artisan migrate --force`, the `config:cache`/`route:cache`/
  `view:cache` steps and only then `php artisan up`. Without the first-deploy flag it
  refuses (before extracting anything) when `php artisan migrate:status` fails on the server
  or there is no `artisan` yet, so it can never run `migrate --force` against a database
  created by the old ZF2 system. If a step fails the site stays in maintenance mode.
- **Per-installation overrides are never deployed.** Five git-ignored files must be placed
  on the server by hand; the deploy keeps them if present:
  1. `lang/{de,en}/booking/local.php`
  2. `config/calendar.local.php`
  3. `lang/{de,en}/booking/quotes.local.php`
  4. `lang/{de,en}/booking/quotes_named.local.php`
  5. `lang/de/booking/quote_groups.php`

**First deploy against a database created by the old ZF2 system.** Deploy the code with
`composer install` and `optimize:clear` only (no `migrate`, no `artisan up`), then run these
manual steps on the server in the app directory, in this order:

1. `php artisan migrate:install`
2. `php artisan db:baseline-legacy --dry-run` (review the output before continuing)
3. `php artisan db:baseline-legacy`
4. `php artisan migrate --force`

Then `php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache` and
`php artisan up`. Later deploys use the plain flow. The cutover design is kept locally and
is not part of the repository.

Legacy ZF2 booking URLs (`/user/bookings`, `/user/settings`, `/user/registration`,
`/user/activation`, `/square/...`, `/backend/...`) are redirected with a temporary
**302** to their Laravel equivalents (not 301, so a rollback to ZF2 is not poisoned by
cached redirects).

**Tournament pages (legacy ZF2) on the same host.** `/tournament`, `/mixed-tournament`,
`/pyramide`, `/draw`, `/service/...` and ZF2's own `/user/login|logout|password[-reset]` are
rewritten by `public/.htaccess` to `public/zf2-bridge.php`, which runs the ZF2 app installed
outside the web root (default location next to the app directory, used **only** when the
app directory is named `bookingnew`; any other directory, e.g. staging, needs the
`ZF2_PUBLIC` env var or an untracked `zf2.path` file in the app root containing the absolute
path of ZF2's `public` dir, otherwise the tournament pages answer 503). There is no separate
tournament subdomain. On every deploy the script symlinks ZF2's static dirs (`css css-client
docs docs-client imgs imgs-client js js-client misc misc-client vendor`) into `public/`.
Members have two logins (Laravel `/login`, ZF2 `/user/login`) with the same credentials. ZF2
runs under the domain's PHP version (8.4). Do not copy the old install's one-off
`public/*.php` maintenance scripts into the ZF2 copy. The routing test table and runbook are
kept locally.

*Historical:* the app was previously hosted on a shared host without SSH and updated by FTP
upload of changed files.

### Character set (emoji)

The legacy `bs_*` tables are `utf8mb3`, while Laravel connects as `utf8mb4`; storing a 4-byte character (emoji) there fails with MySQL error 3988 (HTTP 500). The `App\Http\Middleware\StripFourByteCharacters` middleware (web and api groups) therefore removes 4-byte characters from all request input. The Members module and the API member/due endpoints are exempt (their tables are `utf8mb4` and keep emoji), and credential fields (`password*`, `token`) are never altered; the opt-out list lives on the middleware and must not include the tournament modules while any module path is still bridged to the old app.

## Layout reference

The stable UI layout is marked with the Git tag **`mobile-view-stable`**.

## JSON API & MCP server (Modules/Api)

`Modules/Api` is a self-contained module built with `nwidart/laravel-modules`. It provides a
versioned REST API and an MCP server for external integrations — deliberately without a
public login endpoint; tokens are issued by an admin instead.

> **Why two different "Modules" directories?** `app/Modules/<Name>` (e.g. `app/Modules/Members`)
> and top-level `Modules/<Name>` (e.g. `Modules/Api`) look similar but are unrelated systems
> solving different problems:
>
> - **`app/Modules/*`** is a small homegrown convention (see
>   `app/Console/Commands/MakeModuleCommand.php`, `php artisan make:module`) for
>   self-contained **web-admin UI sections** — own layout, sidebar entry, Blade views,
>   `can()`-gated routes. Used by the Members module.
> - **`Modules/*`** comes from the `nwidart/laravel-modules` package (`php artisan
>   module:make`) and is for **stateless, non-UI feature modules** — no layout, no views,
>   just routes/controllers/services. Used for the API/MCP layer, because it doesn't fit
>   the admin-UI shape `app/Modules/*` is built for.
>
> When adding a new self-contained feature, pick based on whether it needs an admin UI
> (`app/Modules/*`) or not (`Modules/*`) — don't add a third convention.

**Auth**: Laravel Sanctum personal access tokens, issued/revoked at `/admin/api-tokens`
(`App\Http\Controllers\Admin\ApiTokenController`, gated by the `admin.api-tokens`
privilege). Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**REST endpoints** (`/api/v1/...`, create+edit only — no list/show/delete over the API):

| Resource | Endpoints | Privilege |
|---|---|---|
| Booking | `POST/PUT bookings[/{id}]` | `admin.booking` |
| Event | `POST/PUT events[/{id}]` | `admin.event` |
| Member | `POST/PUT members[/{id}]` | `admin.members` |
| Due (Beiträge) | `POST/PUT dues[/{id}]` | `admin.members` |
| — | `GET ping` | any authenticated token |

These reuse the exact same business logic as the admin panel — `App\Services\BookingService`
(conflict checks, repeat/series expansion, owner resolution) and `App\Services\EventService`
(date combination, meta sync) are shared between `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/*` and
`Modules/Api`, not duplicated.

**MCP server**: `POST /api/v1/mcp` (Streamable HTTP transport, via `laravel/mcp`) exposes the
same four resources as MCP tools (`Modules/Api/app/Mcp/Tools`, registered in
`Modules/Api/app/Mcp/Servers/BookingServer.php`). Each tool independently checks the
token user's `admin.*` privilege and returns an MCP error result if missing — the route
itself only requires a valid Sanctum token, since different tools need different privileges.

## Members module

`app/Modules/Members` is a self-contained module (own `MembersServiceProvider`, routes,
migrations, views namespace `members::`, translations namespace `members::admin`) for
club/member administration, separate from the public booking calendar:

| Controller | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MemberController` | Member CRUD (no delete), inline field editing, CSV import |
| `MemberDueController` | Generate/track yearly dues (Beiträge), bulk-mark-paid |
| `FeeCategoryController` | Fee categories with per-fiscal-year rates |
| `FiscalYearController` | Fiscal year management |
| `ClubRoleController` | Club roles/functions (Funktionen), each taggable with multiple mail categories |
| `MailController` | Bulk email composer with templates and dynamic audiences (role/category-based) |
| `DsgvoSettingsController` | GDPR-related settings |
| `DashboardController` | Member/dues statistics and KPI dashboard |
| `PaymentController`, `MemberExportController` | Payment recording, exports |

Routes are protected by `can:admin.members` middleware. See
[app/Modules/Members/routes.php](app/Modules/Members/routes.php).

### Database schema checker

Shared hosting has no SSH/cron access to run `artisan migrate:status`. Instead,
`App\Services\DatabaseSchemaChecker` keeps a manifest of expected tables/columns
(legacy `bs_*` plus module tables) and is used by an admin health-check page to detect
and repair schema drift. **Whenever you add a table or column via a migration, register
it in the checker's manifest too** — otherwise the drift report will flag it as
untracked (a dedicated test guards against this, see
`tests/Unit/Services/DatabaseSchemaCheckerTest.php`).

## Translations

The application is set up for multiple languages.

- German texts live under `lang/de/`
- English texts live under `lang/en/`
- The file `lang/{locale}/booking.php` is now just a loader
- The actual texts are split by topic under `lang/{locale}/booking/`

Current split:

- `public.php` for public UI texts, navigation, auth, registration, calendar and modals
- `account.php` for the account area
- `admin.php` for the admin UI incl. peak-limit configuration
- `repeat.php` for repeat options
- `mail.php` for email texts
- `validation.php` for validation errors
- `messages.php` for flash and status messages

Important:

- Keep using `__('booking...')` in code
- Always add new texts to `lang/de/booking/...` and `lang/en/booking/...` first
- Do not introduce new hardcoded UI texts in Blade files

## Permission model

No roles table. Controlled via `bs_users.status`:

| Status | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Everything |
| `assist` | According to `bs_users_meta` `allow.*` flags |
| `enabled` | Regular bookings |

## Booking modes

- **Singles** (2 players): select teammate via user search (required field)
- **Doubles** (4 players): enter teammates as free text (required field)
