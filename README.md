# Tennis Booking System

Laravel-based court booking system for a tennis club.
Replaces the old Zend/Laminas system (`booking`).

## Stack

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| PHP | 8.3 |
| Laravel | 13.x |
| Database | MySQL (`booking_local`) |
| Frontend | Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Vite |
| Deployment | Shared hosting one.com, FTP |

## Local development

```bash
# Dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Configure .env (DB: booking_local)
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Dev server
php artisan serve       # http://localhost:8001
npm run dev             # Vite HMR

# Tests (via WSL)
php artisan test
```

> **Important:** always run `php`/`composer` via WSL, never directly in PowerShell.

## Deployment (one.com)

1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Commit `public/build/`
3. Transfer changed files to the server via FTP

No Node.js on the server — the Vite build must be built and committed locally.

## Layout reference

The stable UI layout is marked with the Git tag **`mobile-view-stable`**.
See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for details on the design system.

```bash
# Reset to the stable layout state (individual files)
git checkout mobile-view-stable -- public/css/booking.css
git checkout mobile-view-stable -- resources/views/components/layout/header.blade.php
```

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `public/css/booking.css` | Main CSS incl. mobile-responsive styles |
| `resources/css/calendar-grid.css` | Calendar grid layout |
| `resources/views/components/layout/header.blade.php` | App header (desktop + mobile) |
| `resources/views/components/calendar/grid.blade.php` | Calendar grid |
| `resources/views/components/calendar/modals.blade.php` | Booking modals (Alpine.js) |
| `resources/views/admin/` | Admin area |
| `app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php` | Booking logic (user) |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/BookingController.php` | Booking logic (admin) |
| `app/Services/PeakLimitService.php` | Peak-time limiting |

## Translations

The application is set up for multiple languages.

- German texts live under `lang/de/`
- English texts live under `lang/en/`
- The file `lang/{locale}/booking.php` is now just a loader
- The actual texts are split by topic under `lang/{locale}/booking/`

Current split:

- `public.php` for public UI texts, navigation, auth, registration, calendar and modals
- `account.php` for the account area
- `admin.php` for the admin UI incl. peak-limit configuration
- `repeat.php` for repeat options
- `mail.php` for email texts
- `validation.php` for validation errors
- `messages.php` for flash and status messages

Important:

- Keep using `__('booking...')` in code
- Always add new texts to `lang/de/booking/...` and `lang/en/booking/...` first
- Do not introduce new hardcoded UI texts in Blade files

## Permission model

No roles table. Controlled via `bs_users.status`:

| Status | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Everything |
| `assist` | According to `bs_users_meta` `allow.*` flags |
| `enabled` | Regular bookings |

## Booking modes

- **Singles** (2 players): select teammate via user search (required field)
- **Doubles** (4 players): enter teammates as free text (required field)
